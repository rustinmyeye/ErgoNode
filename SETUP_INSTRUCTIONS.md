# How to use Ergo Node for Android

## Getting Started

This app is intended to run on **aarch64**-based Android devices with the following minimum system requirements:
- Android OS version **7.0 or higher**.
- **At least 4 GB of free internal storage**.
- **At least 3 GB of total system RAM** (more recommended for better performance).

So far, this has been tested and works well on a **Samsung Galaxy S8+** and a **Google Pixel 6a**.

## First-Time Setup

1. Download the latest release `.apk` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/rustinmyeye/ErgoNodeAndroid/releases) onto your Android device.

2. Locate the `.apk` file in your **Downloads** folder and tap on it to begin the installation. If prompted, you may need to **allow installation from unknown sources** in your device's "Settings" under **Security**.

3. Open the app and tap on **“Start the Node”**. A pop-up will appear about **storage requirements**. Tap **OK** to proceed. (the pop up says ~25 GB will be used, but the current install actually uses ~2.9 GB)

4. The app will begin setting up the environment for the node installation.

5. **Allow the app access to internal storage**. This is necessary for downloading required files and configuring the node.

6. The app will automatically download all necessary components to start the node.

7. On the first run, the app will generate a **unique API key**, **Blake hash**, and a **configuration file**. It will then start the node.

8. On subsequent runs, the app will check the existing configuration file and simply start the node.

## Accessing the Node Panel

To monitor the progress of the node, visit the **Ergo Node Panel** in a browser on the device:  
**[https://127.0.0.1:9053/panel](https://127.0.0.1:9053/panel)**

- **127.0.0.1** refers to **localhost**, i.e., the device running the node.
- If you want to monitor the node from another device, replace **127.0.0.1** with the **local IP** or **public IP (if port forwarding is set up)** of the device running the node.
- The first sync can take some time. the node will sync headers, then download UTXO snapshot chunks (there is no progress bar for this), then finally start syncing remaining blocks. The node is ready to use when the blocks are 100% synced (green bar in web panel).

## Using the Node  

You can interact with the node either through the **Node Panel web interface**, via the **API**, or by connecting it to the **Ergo Wallet app**.  

1. **Using the Node Panel**:  
   Copy the **API key** generated by the app and paste it into the panel using the **“Set API Key”** button. After doing this, you will be able to initialize a wallet and submit transactions directly through the node.  

2. **Using the Node in the Ergo Wallet App**:  
   If you want to use your locally running node within the Ergo Wallet app, go to **Settings** → **Node & API Connections**, and set the **Node URL** to:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:9053/
   ```
   This allows the wallet app to connect directly to your node for improved privacy and control.  

### **Caution**:  
If you choose to initialize a wallet through the Node Panel, **write down the seed phrase** immediately! There is **no recovery** if you lose it. **Keep it safe** at all costs!
