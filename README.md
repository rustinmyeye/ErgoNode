To Do
=======

- figure out android memory management
- reimplement automatic java heap size setup for the node in the install script
- maybe setup swap space in alpine linux? dunno if that helps
- make ui look better and work in all devices
- remove unsused parts from neotern maybe?
- include install scripts in apk maybe
- create menu with hep links, config editor and allow user to create their own API key through menu.
- inclue mixer as an opsional install. It can run alongside the node... and use custom config file maybe
