# Ergo Node for Android  

Setup instructions [here](https://github.com/rustinmyeye/ErgoNodeAndroid/blob/master/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

A one-click Ergo node app for Android. This app is based on **NeoTerm**, and runs automated install scripts to set up and run an Ergo node on Android.

The current version of this app bootstraps via NiPoPoW and a UTXO set snapshot to run the Ergo node.
