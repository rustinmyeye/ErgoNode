Ergo Node for Android
=======

Setup instructions [here](https://github.com/rustinmyeye/ErgoNodeAndroid/blob/master/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

An attempt at a one click Ergo node app for Android. This app is based on neoterm, and runs automated install scripts to setup and run an Ergo node on Android. 

The current version of this app setus up a stateless light node, and it syncs very quickly. I will make a release for full node setup shortly.
