Credits
=======

This is a fork of [NeoTerm](https://github.com/NeoTerrm/NeoTerm)

I'm using some parts of Ergo Node setup scripts from [Mark Glasgow](https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergoscripts)

also - [proot-distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro), [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), [Ergo Protocol refence client](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases)

To Do
=======

- figure out how to automate the initial apt update. Right now the user needs to press enter to continue...I think its something inside the NeoTerm distro... not sure.
- add links or descriptions about how to use the node with Ergo Wallet app.
- figure out a better script to run the node.
- make "shut down the node" button maybe. the node cam become corrupted if you kill from in android
- create a link, or WebView on top of the term windows to show node panel at 127.0.0.1:9053/panel
- remove "new session" buttons
