This is a fork of [NeoTerm](https://github.com/NeoTerrm/NeoTerm)

I'm using some parts of Ergo Node setup scripts from [Mark Glasgow](https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergoscripts)

also - [proot-distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro), [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), [Ergo Protocol refence client](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases)

To Do
